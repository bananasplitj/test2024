            <h2>Euphoria</h2>
            <h4>In Love With Liberty</h4>
            <h4>The world <strong>Tailor-Made</strong> for Their Freedom</h4>
            <p>They were in love with liberty. It seemed to them that the whole world was tailor-made for them.</p>
            <p>They lived at the exact tempo of their thirst, and their exuberance was irrepressible; their enthusiasm knew no bounds.</p>

            <h4>All night.</h4>

                <li><em>Walked</em></li>

            <p>They would venture out only once night had fallen, to go and eat a plain steak in an expensive caf√©.</p>

            <h2>Determination</h2>
            <h3><strong>They wouldn't meet the day after.</strong></h3>
            <h5>The couples would</h5>
            <h5>stay at home, dieting, feeling queasy,</h5> 
            <h5>overindulging in black coffee and soluble aspirin.</h5>
            <p><em>They would make draconian resolutions: no more smoking, no more drinking, no more wasting money.</em></p>

        <div id="confusion" class="pillar confusion">
            <h2>Confusion</h2>
            <p>They would feel <strong>empty and stupid</strong>, and in their memory of their magnificent drinking bout there would always be a:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><em><strong>hint of yearning,</strong></em></li>
                <li><em><strong>a vague annoyance,</strong></em></li>
                <li><em><strong>a feeling of ambiguity,</strong></em></li>
            </ul>
            <p>As if the very impulse which had made them drink had only reawakened in them a much deeper perplexity.</p>
